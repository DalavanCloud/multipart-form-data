multipart-form-data
===================

Update to RFC 2388, to allow HTML5 to normatively reference it. 

HTML5-desc.html  started as an excerpt from the then-current HTML5 reference
                 and will be edited to match this new draft instead.


Use xml2rfc to convert .xml file into .html and .txt. 

Use a browser's save as PDF from .html to make a pdf.
