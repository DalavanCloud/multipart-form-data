===================

Update to RFC 2388, to allow HTML5 to normatively reference it. 

HTML5-desc.html  started as an excerpt from the then-current HTML5 reference
                 and will be edited to match this new draft instead.


Use xml2rfc to convert .xml file into .html, .txt, and then acrobat to
convert .html to .html.pdf.
