multipart-form-data
===================

Update to RFC 2388, to allow HTML5 to normatively reference it. 

`HTML5-excerpt.html` started as an excerpt from the then-current HTML5 reference; it should be edited to match this new draft instead.


Use xml2rfc to convert .xml file into .html and .txt, and use a browser's save as PDF to convert from .html to pdf.

Periodically submit Internet Draft to make

       http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-multipart-form-data

an IETF submission.
